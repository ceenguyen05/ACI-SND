**Design rule:** `src/sim` never touches the DOM or WebGL. The renderer, audio and UI subscribe
to the simulation's `EventBus` and read its state each frame. Because of this, entire
bot-vs-bot matches run in Node tests, and the same simulation runs unchanged inside the
authoritative multiplayer server.

## Testing & verification

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run check` | Typecheck + tests + production build: exactly what CI runs on every push |
| `npm run check:boot` | Serves the build from `/ACI-SND/` (like GitHub Pages), boots it in headless Chromium, starts a Search & Destroy match and a Zombies game, and fails on any missing file or error. Runs in CI; needs a build first |
| `npm run typecheck` | Strict TypeScript checks |
| `npm test` | 320+ unit, simulation and server tests. `tests/online/` covers rooms, matchmaking, input validation, snapshot replication and prediction, a real WebSocket server, MySQL/file storage, XP and ranks. `tests/zombies/` has the Zombies tests (formulas, layout validity, waves, points, purchases, perks, revives, specials, power-ups, box and forge, every zombie kind, a bot squad, motor tunnelling) plus the Search & Destroy suite (plus an optional balance report), including prone and slide (clearance, hitboxes, crouch modes), Gunsmith attachments, rebuy/auto-buy, mantling, coyote time, burst fire, stun, throwing knives, the heartbeat sensor, pings and killcam recording, including movement (crouch-jump, stamina), wallbangs, foot placement, weapon handling, input buffering, aim assist, every gadget, the stim pistol, barricades, launchers, C4 and killstreaks. They cover map connectivity, prop/wall overlap, raycasts, damage/armor, spray patterns, economy, and **complete bot-vs-bot matches** (rounds, plants, halftime swap, money limits) |
| `npm run smoke` | Builds, serves, and drives the real game in headless Chromium: title → every menu page → start match → buy menu purchase → quality presets with FPS readout → an accelerated all-bot match until it ends. Fails on any console error and saves screenshots to `screenshots/` |
| `npm run screenshots` | Visual tour of 16 map locations and 8 view models (`screenshots/tour/`) |
| `npm run perf` | FPS per graphics preset on your GPU |
| `npm run bake` | Re-bake the map's lightmaps after changing the map (about 10 s) |
| `node scripts/visual/arsenal-look.mjs` | Screenshots of the buy menu, new view models, barricades, RPG blast and missile view (`screenshots/arsenal/`) |
| `node scripts/visual/sights-look.mjs [--spray] [--dpr=1.5]` | Every gun at the hip and aimed at a target, with 3× centre crops marked at the exact screen centre. `--spray` fires real bursts and prints how far the crosshair sits from the last impact (`screenshots/sights/`) |
| `npm run test:handling` | Real keyboard/mouse movement, jump, crouch, hold-to-prone, release-to-stand, slide/cooldown, automatic fire, reload and ADS checks, plus screenshots and graphics-preset measurements in `screenshots/handling/` |
| `npm run test:visual` | High-quality character poses, architecture, weapon animation, WebGL errors and repeated gadget cleanup; screenshots, a motion-review video and a JSON report in `screenshots/visual/` |
| `npm run test:keys` | Presses the new combat keys in the real game (quick melee, self-stim, killstreak, C4 detonate, cameras, ping, stim dart, weapon light) and checks each one works |
| `node scripts/visual/qol-look.mjs` | Screenshots of the round tips, Rebuy / Auto-buy, objective markers and the settings page (`screenshots/qol/`) |
| `node scripts/perf/frame-cost.mjs` | Per-frame CPU cost (simulation, view, HUD, render) per quality preset – unaffected by other load on the machine |
| `node scripts/visual/gunsmith-look.mjs` | Buys and fits attachments through the real buy menu, then screenshots the Gunsmith tab, a kitted rifle, red-dot / holo / ACOG aiming, an enemy laser and an enemy light (`screenshots/gunsmith/`) |
| `node scripts/visual/moments-look.mjs` | Screenshots of the new guns, gear, heartbeat screen, pings, stun, multi-kill banner and the killcam, then checks the next round starts (`screenshots/moments/`) |
| `npm run balance [difficulty] [seeds]` | Win-rate and kill statistics over ~60 simulated rounds |
| `npm run test:zombies` | Plays Zombies in the browser through the new menus with a bot squad, then stages every zombie type, the machines, power-ups, hazards, downed / revive, armory, exfil and end screen; reports horde FPS and fails on console errors (`screenshots/zombies/`) |
| `SOAK=1 npx vitest run tests/zombies/zombies-soak.test.ts --silent=false` | Long all-bot Zombies games: progression, per-system timings, no stalled waves, nobody stuck in a closed area |
| `npm run test:online` | Only the online/server/progression tests (`tests/online/`) |
| `npm run test:online:browser` | Two real browsers against the real game server: private room, Play now, purchases, gunfire, movement, bot takeover, public queue, co-op Zombies revive/Armory and online XP |
| `npm run test:gunplay` | Real-browser gunplay regression with visual evidence |
| `npm run diag` | Loads the build in Chromium and prints console output and any fatal-error overlay (`-- --dev` for readable dev-server stacks) |
| `npm run verify` | Full pre-release pass: `check` + `check:boot` + smoke, real-key, Zombies and two-browser online checks (needs a GPU) |

`npx playwright install chromium` downloads the headless browser that the browser checks use.
Add `--swiftshader` to any browser script to use software rendering like CI does.

## CI and deployment

GitHub Actions runs on every push and pull request:

| Event | What runs |
|---|---|
| Push to any other branch / open a PR | **CI**: typecheck, tests, build, then a browser boot check of the build |
| Push to `main` (or Actions → *Deploy to GitHub Pages* → Run workflow) | **CI**, then the tested build is published to GitHub Pages (set the Actions variable `DEPLOY_GITHUB_PAGES=false` to skip Pages) |

| Piece | Host | Deploys |
|---|---|---|
| Game website | Vercel (Git integration) or GitHub Pages | Static `dist/` from `npm run build`; set `VITE_MULTIPLAYER_URL` to the game server's `wss://…/online` |
| Multiplayer server | Render (`render.yaml`) or any Node/Docker host | `npm start`; Render redeploys `main` after CI passes |
| Online profiles | MySQL (Aiven) or a persistent `DATA_DIR` volume | Server-only credentials, never `VITE_*` |

Step-by-step setup: [ONLINE_DEPLOYMENT.md](ONLINE_DEPLOYMENT.md). CI, Pages, rollback and
troubleshooting: [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).
